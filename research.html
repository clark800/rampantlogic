<strong>Focus</strong> We are currently working on several research projects in the fields of computer science and applied mathematics. <br /><br />

<strong>Programming Language Theory</strong> One of our main projects is to design a variant of the C programming language that speeds development without sacrificing the simplicity, efficiency, and beauty of the original language. The philosophy behind this concept is that a language should be minimal and strict. This goes against the philosophy of many modern languages which provide flexibility and extensive features. We believe that strictness reduces opportunities for bugs and prevents inefficiency from indecison due to too many options.  Furthermore, such strictness makes it easier to read other people's code. Simplicity in the language makes it easier to learn, while the advanced features can always be coded on top of the simple foundation. Additionally, we would like to preserve most of the syntax since it closely resembles mathematical notation.
